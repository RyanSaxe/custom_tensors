# TensorGuide

This repository is meant to be a project for the purpose of learning about autodifferentiation. PyTorch and TensorFlow are two very popular, and well optimized using C++ code, autodifferentiation frameworks. The goal of this repository is not to compete with that, but rather be the lightest-weight and easiest-to-read python code that implements autodifferentiation from scratch (no NumPy!).

If you're a Machine Learning Scientist or Data Scientist that wants to understand more about autodifferentiation, but are stuck, this repository is for you. It's not a blog post or youtube video trying to explain the concept. It's not a highly optimized framework for building production quality systems or research. By being neither of those things, it becomes easy to fully peel back the onion and look into exactly how every operation works. I hope you enjoy!
